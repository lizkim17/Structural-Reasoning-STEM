# Structural-Reasoning-STEM
Repository for the final data coding of my master's thesis on how structural information influences children's explanations about gender disparities in STEM. I worked on this project at the University of Chicago in the EArly Social Thinkers Laboratory under the mentorship of Dr. Rongzhi Liu, a postdoctoral researcher in the lab.
